## 🏠 Abstract

Robotic systems demand accurate and comprehensive 3D environment perception, requiring simultaneous capture of a comprehensive representation of photo-realistic appearance (optical), precise layout shape (geometric), and open-vocabulary scene understanding (semantic). Existing methods typically achieve only partial fulfillment of these requirements while exhibiting optical blurring, geometric irregularities, and semantic ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose OmniMap. Overall, OmniMap represents the first online mapping framework that simultaneously captures optical, geometric, and semantic scene attributes while maintaining real-time performance and model compactness. At the architectural level, OmniMap employs a tightly coupled 3DGS–Voxel hybrid representation that combines fine-grained modeling with structural stability. At the implementation level, OmniMap identifies key challenges across different modalities and introduces several innovations: adaptive camera modeling for motion blur and exposure compensation, hybrid incremental representation with normal constraints, and probabilistic fusion for robust instance-level understanding. Extensive experiments show OmniMap's superior performance in rendering fidelity, geometric accuracy, and zero-shot semantic segmentation compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse scenes. The framework's versatility is further evidenced through a variety of downstream applications including multi-domain scene Q&A, interactive edition, perception-guided manipulation, and map-assisted navigation.

## 🛠 Install

Tested on Ubuntu 20.04/24.04 with CUDA 11.8.

### Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BIT-DYN/omnimap.git
cd omnimap
```

### Install the required libraries

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate omnimap
```

### Install torch-scatter

```bash
pip install torch-scatter -f https://data.pyg.org/whl/torch-2.1.2+cu118.html
```

### Set CUDA environment

Run this every time before using the environment, or add to conda activation script:

```bash
export CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX
export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

To make it permanent, add to conda activate script:
```bash
mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d
echo 'export CUDA_HOME=$CONDA_PREFIX
export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDA_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' > $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/cuda_env.sh
```

### Install thirdparty components

```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation thirdparty/simple-knn
pip install --no-build-isolation thirdparty/diff-gaussian-rasterization
pip install --no-build-isolation thirdparty/lietorch
```

### Install YOLO-World Model

```bash
cd ..
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AILab-CVC/YOLO-World.git
cd YOLO-World
pip install mmcv==2.1.0 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu118/torch2.1/index.html
pip install -r <(grep -v "opencv-python" requirements/basic_requirements.txt)
pip install -e .
cd ../omnimap
```

If `pip install -e .` fails, try: `pip install --no-build-isolation -e .`

**Fix YOLO-World syntax error:** In `YOLO-World/yolo_world/models/detectors/yolo_world.py` line 61, replace:
```python
self.text_feats, None = self.backbone.forward_text(texts)
```
with:
```python
self.text_feats, _ = self.backbone.forward_text(texts)
```

```

### Modify the model path

Change the address of the above models in the configuration file in `config/`.

### Verify installation

```bash
python -c "import torch; import mmcv; import mmdet; from tokenize_anything import model_registry; print('Setup complete!')"
```

## 📊 Prepare dataset

OmniMap has completed validation on Replica (as same with [vMap](https://github.com/kxhit/vMAP)) and ScanNet. Please download the following datasets.

* [Replica Demo](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kxic/vMAP/resolve/main/demo_replica_room_0.zip) - Replica Room 0 only for faster experimentation.
* [Replica](https://huggingface.co/datasets/kxic/vMAP/resolve/main/vmap.zip) - All Pre-generated Replica sequences.
* [ScanNet](https://github.com/ScanNet/ScanNet) - Official ScanNet sequences.

Update the dataset path in `config/replica_config.yaml` or `config/scannet_config.yaml`:
```yaml
path:
  data_path: /path/to/your/dataset
```

## 🏃 Run

### Main Code

Run the following command to start the formal execution of the incremental mapping.

```bash
# for replica
python demo.py --dataset replica --scene {scene} --vis_gui
# for scannet
python main.py --dataset scannet --scene {scene} --vis_gui
```

You can use `--start {start_id}` and `--length {length}` to specify the starting frame ID and the mapping duration, respectively. The `--vis_gui` flag controls online visualization; disabling it may improve processing speed.

After building the map, the results will be saved in folder `outputs/{scene}`, which contains the rendered outputs and evaluation metrics.

### Gen 3D Mesh

We use the rendered depth and color images to generate the color mesh. You can run the following code to perform this operation.

```bash
# for replica
python tsdf_integrate.py --dataset replica --scene {scene}
# for scannet
python tsdf_integrate.py --dataset scannet --scene {scene}
```
